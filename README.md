# Vaadin Questionnaire

A simple questionnaire component for Vaadin 23, can be used for adding user surveys into an app.

It was inspired by the earlier component by the same name in the Vaadin directory

[Questionnaire](https://vaadin.com/directory/component/questionnaire)

with the same data model (almost) but UI components re-written for compatibility with Vaadin 23.
